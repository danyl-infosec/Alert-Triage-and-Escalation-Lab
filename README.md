# Alert-Triage-and-Escalation-Lab

## Objective
Investigate a phishing alert detected post‑delivery, validate authenticity using email security checks, and determine whether escalation is required.

## Step 1 – Identify Highest Priority Alert
- Reviewed unassigned alerts in the SOC queue.  
- Two medium‑priority alerts were present; I selected the one that arrived first.  
- **Alert Title:** *“Email marked as phishing after delivery.”*

---

## Step 2 – Assign & Update Status
- Assigned the alert to myself.  
- Changed status from **“Awaiting Action” → “In Progress”** to signal ownership to SOC teammates.

---

## Step 3 – Investigation
- Read the alert description to gather context.  
- Automated analysis flagged an email as phishing post‑delivery.  
- **Sender:** “Microsoft Support” `<support@microsoft.com>`  
- **Recipient:** Eddie Huffman (IT Manager)  
- **Subject:** Microsoft Teams price increase  
- **Attachment:** Urgent download request  

### Security Checks
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Failed → sending mail server not authorized.  
- **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Failed → integrity/signature invalid.  

### Assessment
Both checks failing strongly indicate spoofing. The attachment is likely malicious and could enable privilege escalation or compromise of the organization’s network.

## Step 4 – Analyst Actions
- Added analyst comment summarizing findings.  
- Updated severity: **Medium to Critical**.  
- Updated verdict: **True Positive**.  
- Escalated alert to Level 2 analyst for deeper investigation and containment.

## Lessons Learned
- SPF/DKIM validation is critical in confirming sender authenticity.  
- Attackers often exploit urgency (“download immediately”) to trick recipients.
